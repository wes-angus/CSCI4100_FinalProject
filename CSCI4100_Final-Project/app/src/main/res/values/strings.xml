        This application was co-created by Wesley Angus and Montgomery Alban for a final project in
        the CSCI 4100 course at UOIT (also known as Mobile Devices).\n\n
        This is an application that lets you view and manage a list of upcoming video games,
        as well as when you are planning to purchase each game (if at all).\n\n
        The RSS Feed used in this application is taken from one of the free feeds available from
        GameSpot.com, specifically the list of upcoming releases at:
        gamespot.com/feeds/new-releases/.\n\n
        All of the sounds used in this application were free sounds taken from freesound.org.\n\n
