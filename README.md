# CSCI4100_FinalProject
Final project for the "Mobile Devices" (CSCI 4100) course at UOIT.

This readMe explains the use of this application.

From the Main Menu screen, you can click on one of the center 3 buttons to open up other screens to view a list of purchased games (if you have labeled any as having bought them), a list of new game releases, and a screen to view text concerning the application and any internet sources used. The find stores button enables the gps and allows you to look around nearby and then get directions to the location you choose.

Button --> Activity
View Bought List --> view list of purchased games
Show New Game Releases --> view list of new game releases
About the App --> view the "About" text in a dialog that can be closed
Find Stores --> Allows to to look at nearby places and get directions

The lists can be scrolled through and searched using the search bar at the top of the app.
Selecting a game in the new game releases list brings you to another screen, which lets you view the game's information including its description, lets you click a button to open a link in a browser containing additional information about the game, and has a button to create a Calendar event concerning that game's release.
The main purpose of this activity, however; is to select an option from the dropdown menu, denoting when you are planning to buy the game that is being viewed (if at all).
Based on this value, you may be asked to confirm its removal from the list of new games after you hit the "Save" button, which saves the value.
You can also denote whether you have already purchased the game in question by checking the "Bought" checkbox, after which you are prompted for a confirmation, since it will be moved permanently to the list of purchased games and cannot be moved back.

Viewing the list of purchased games works much the same as viewing the new game releases list, but selecting a game simply opens up the link concerning the game in a browser.
The description is also displayed along with the game in the list itself rather than in a separate screen and the release date is not shown since you have already purchased the game, and viewing the release date would be fairly pointless at that point.
